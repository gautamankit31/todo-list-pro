# To-Do List Pro

**To-Do List Pro** is a powerful, user-friendly task management application that helps you organize your tasks efficiently. It allows you to prioritize tasks, categorize them, and manage everything from a sleek, responsive interface built with **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**. Tasks are stored locally in the browser using **localStorage**, so your data is safe even after a page reload.

## Features

- **Task Prioritization**: Assign tasks a priority level (High, Medium, or Low) and sort them accordingly.
- **Task Categories**: Organize your tasks into categories such as Work, Home, or Self for better management.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find tasks by title using the search feature.
- **Sort by Priority**: Sort tasks based on priority levels for easy task management.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter tasks by category to focus on specific areas of your to-do list.
- **Grid and Flexbox Layout**: A modern, responsive design that places the task input and display areas neatly in the center of the screen using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Automatically saves tasks in the browser, ensuring your to-dos persist across sessions.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS (Grid & Flexbox)**: Used to style the application, centering elements and providing a clean, responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Manages task creation, prioritization, filtering, sorting, and saving to local storage.
